Instead of adding packets \r\nduring a packet trace in order to obfuscate which page it came from, \r\nGLUE adds packets between packet traces (during user think \r\ntime/downtime) to merge them together, creating a seamless sequence of \r\npackets covering multiple page loads. Attackers are unable to train \r\nclassifiers for multiple contiguous traces and also unable to identify \r\nindividual page traces from the sequence. This is in part because the \r\nGLUE used is itself a real packet trace, thwarting attacker \r\nclassification. GLUE also adds extra noise packets (\"FRONT\") in the \r\nfirst trace as it is vulnerable otherwise.\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2019/posters/hotcrp_sp19posters-final6.pdf\r\nhttps://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20summer_gong_prepub.pdf",
